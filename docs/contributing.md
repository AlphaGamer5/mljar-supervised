- For code formatting we use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

To run all tests locally:

```
pytest tests 
```

To run only tests for selected file (for example NN algorithm):
```
pytest tests/tests_algorithms/test_nn.py -vsx
```

I add `vsx` flags to see what's going on.

The project documentation is on GitHub in [docs](/docs) directory.
